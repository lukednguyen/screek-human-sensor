## About
This is the source code for the DIY sensors we make, you are free to modify them and use them, and feel free to provide suggestions to us.  

Consider the current privacy so extravagant, and the severe dependence on cloud services. Open source can bring better privacy, and more personalized customization.

## üôè
The sensor builds and code have gotten a lot of concerted effort, and ingenuity, from many, many people.


## Something else to say

We insist on keeping our principles of code openness on Home Assistant sensors because we strongly believe in it:
- Code that is fully localized to run without malicious behavior and is readily available for everyone to review is more reassuring.
- It's great to have the wisdom of everyone working together to improve the source code.

But at the same time we must apologize that we don't have enough energy to run an open source community at the moment, so our open source code may not be up to date or well commented.

We hope you'll forgive us for having to spend most of our spare time limited to building and testing hardware, as well as exploring some new areas, and hopefully often getting a chance to take a walk with our families.
